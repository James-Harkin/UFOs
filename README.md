# UFOs
## Overview:
Dana has a javascript file, filed to the brim with information on UFO sightings. Her plan is to use javascript to display the table on an HTML page.
Our goal is to add filters to that page to make the table easier to navigate.

## Results:
Ufo sightings happen all across the world. There were few places that had multiple sightings. Most of the sightings were scattered throughout the globe.
To navigate, you simply type into any or all of the text boxes. And then finally, to filter, press enter and look for results.

## Summary:
Being able to type and look for certain results works well if you are looking for something specific. But it lacks the ability to tell the user how many of something. Another drawback is that there is no way to filter without typing.

## Improvements:
Add a counter that tells you how many results were found.
Add on click functionality that lets the user click on a data field and immediately filter for it OR add it to the respective text box.
